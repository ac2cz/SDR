# SDR for the Radio Amateur
Experimental Methods in DSP design

I have spent several years getting to grips with Digital Signal Processing. Most of that effort was needed to write the FoxTelem telemetry decoder. If you have ever looked at the source code, you will see that it was definitely a learning experience. But it was also really fun and hugely rewarding.

Creating a Software Defined Radio or signal processing are good modern homebrew projects. Here I will explain how a software defined radio works to help other amateurs with their learning. This set of tutorials takes you from how to write a single component to a fully working SDR.
